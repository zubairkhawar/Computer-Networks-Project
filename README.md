# Computer-Networks-Project
# Advanced Network Integration with EIGRP, RIP, OSPF, and LANs

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a comprehensive computer network integrating multiple routing protocols and Local Area Networks (LANs) to achieve optimal connectivity and efficiency. The project encompasses the deployment and configuration of Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and various LAN segments to create a robust and versatile network infrastructure.

# Objectives
To design a scalable and efficient network architecture that leverages the strengths of different routing protocols.
To ensure seamless interoperability between different routing domains and protocols.
To enhance network performance, redundancy, and reliability through strategic protocol integration.
To gain hands-on experience in configuring and managing complex network setups.

# Key Components

# EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
EIGRP is configured to provide fast convergence and efficient network utilization.
It uses advanced metrics and supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) to optimize routing decisions.
Implementation includes configuring EIGRP on routers to exchange routing information within an autonomous system.

# RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
RIP is deployed to demonstrate a simple, distance-vector routing protocol.
The project involves setting up RIP in a small segment of the network to show its ease of use and limitations.
Configuration includes setting up RIP routers to broadcast updates at regular intervals.

# OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
OSPF is used to highlight its capabilities as a link-state routing protocol suitable for large and complex networks.
The project configures OSPF areas to demonstrate hierarchical network design and efficient routing.
Features such as OSPF areas, DR/BDR election, and route summarization are implemented.

# LAN Segments
Multiple LAN segments are created to represent different network zones (e.g., departments, floors, or branches).
Each LAN is connected through switches and routers, configured with appropriate VLANs to manage broadcast domains and enhance security.
The project illustrates the segmentation of the network for better traffic management and performance.
Implementation Steps

# Network Design
A comprehensive network topology is designed using network simulation software (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3).
The topology includes multiple routers, switches, and end devices connected through EIGRP, RIP, and OSPF.

# Configuration
EIGRP, RIP, and OSPF are configured on respective routers with necessary network statements, authentication, and metrics.
LAN segments are created with VLANs on switches and appropriate IP addressing schemes.
Inter-VLAN routing is configured to allow communication between different VLANs.

# Testing and Optimization
Network connectivity and routing tables are verified to ensure accurate routing information exchange.
Failover and redundancy tests are performed to evaluate the resilience of the network.
Performance metrics such as convergence time, packet loss, and latency are monitored and optimized.

# Results and Analysis
The network demonstrates successful integration of EIGRP, RIP, and OSPF, with each protocol operating effectively within its domain.
Seamless communication between different LAN segments is achieved through proper VLAN and routing configurations.
The project showcases the advantages and limitations of each routing protocol in a real-world network scenario.
Analytical data on network performance provides insights into the efficiency and reliability of the integrated network setup.

# Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of integrating multiple routing protocols and LANs in a cohesive network architecture. By leveraging the strengths of EIGRP, RIP, and OSPF, the network achieves optimal performance, scalability, and resilience. This hands-on experience reinforces the theoretical knowledge of networking principles and prepares for more advanced network design and management challenges.
